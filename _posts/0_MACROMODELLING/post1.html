                <h3>Why do we need macroeconomic models?</h3>
                <p>

                    Economic models are a representation of reality. To understand observed trends in the economy - such as financial crisis, how income grows, why people are unemployed or why prices are rising, we need to abstract a number of elements and focus on others. 

                    What to neglect and what to consider is a crucial part of building economic models. The more elements (or endogenous variables) a model incorporates, the harder it is to see the model's insights. On the other hand, the less variables you employ, the more insightful the model is, albeit more information you loose. For this reason, we share the view of George E. P. Box that *"All models are wrong, but some are useful"*.


                    Economic models have different purposes. One of them is designing economic policies. Given that economic models are often a mathematical framework, they can provide numerical estimates of policy options. And often they are used by government departments, such as Central Banks, to base policy-decisions. For their aggregated nature, policy design is mostly done through macroeconomic models.


                    Some real-world problems, however, are often neglected by standard economic theory, which is known as neoclassical economics. One such problem is the role of finance in economic dynamics. 

                    Financial markets include various agents and instruments. In addition to the stock market, credit creation by banks, the issuance of bonds by the national treasury and even interest bearing deposits are part of the financial system. Nevertheless, most of these elements are largely absent in neoclassical macroeconomic modelling.


                    But is money, or any other financial instrument, irrelevant for understanding economic dynamics?

                    By retrieving data from the Harvard Business School <p> (available <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here)</a>.</p>  
                    
                    I have calculated the number of banking crisis, by year, since 1800:
